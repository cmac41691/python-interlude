## Week 2 Reflection — Files & Functions

This week I built a small CLI tool that uses JSON for persistent storage.

Key takeaways:
- I learned how to safely load data with a fallback when a file doesn’t exist.
- I separated how data is stored from how it’s displayed to the user.
- Using commands like `view`, `update`, and `q` helped me think in terms of backend control flow.
- Writing pseudocode first made the Python implementation much easier to reason about.

This project helped me understand how backend programs manage state across sessions.
