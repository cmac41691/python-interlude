### Week 3 – Contact Manager (Early Progress)

This week I focused on designing the contact manager using pseudocode before writing Python.
I defined core helper functions such as `create_contact` and `add_contact` and verified that they work together correctly.

One important realization was understanding that defining functions alone does not execute any logic.
Running the script multiple times produced no output, which helped reinforce how Python executes files top-down and only runs code that is explicitly called.

I also practiced passing data structures (lists and dictionaries) between functions and using helper functions to avoid duplication.
This project is helping me understand how larger programs are built from small, focused pieces.

Next steps will be implementing the remaining contact operations (view, search, update, delete) and adding a main loop to connect everything together.
