## Week 1 – Number Analyzer Reflection

This exercise helped reinforce how to structure a loop-driven CLI program.

Key takeaways:
- Writing pseudocode first made translating to Python much easier.
- Separating input validation into a helper function (`integer_input`) improved readability.
- Handling invalid input without crashing was a major focus.
- Boolean logic (`number % 2 == 0`) is becoming more intuitive.
- Early exit conditions (`q` / `quit`) simplify control flow.

Challenges:
- Deciding where validation logic should live.
- Understanding when to use `continue` vs `break`.
- Avoiding overly complex conditionals.

What I’d improve next:
- Refactor into a main function.
- Add support for negative numbers.
- Improve user messaging.

Overall, this was a strong confidence-building exercise.
