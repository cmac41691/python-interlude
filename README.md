# python-interlude
A focused Python practice repo for strengthening backend fundamentals before starting the Meta Backend Developer program.  Includes pseudocode → Python exercises, logic drills, small utilities, and workflow routines.

## Goals
This interlude strengthens Python fundamentals before starting the Meta Backend Developer program.  
Focus areas include:
- Pseudocode → Python translation
- Logic drills and pattern recognition
- Functions, loops, and small utilities
- Clean code and consistent workflow (Git, VS Code)

## Learning Philosophy

This interlude is designed as a student–teacher exercise.
I deliberately slow down to:
- identify weak areas
- articulate logic in pseudocode
- reflect on mistakes and improvements

The goal is long-term backend readiness, not speed.
